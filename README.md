# ShadowFox_Project
# DataScience

This project contains work on three different tasks assigned for learning data analysis and visualization.

# Task 1 – Visualization Library Documentation

I explored two popular Python libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn. I explained what they are, the types of graphs they offer, and included sample code for each chart (line, bar, scatter, etc.). I also compared both libraries in terms of usage and features.

# Task 2 – Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – Delhi

In this task, I studied AQI levels in Delhi using the provided dataset. I focused on pollutants, seasonal changes, and how location affects air quality. I used graphs and basic statistics to understand trends and help suggest improvements for public health.

# Task 3 – IPL Fielding Performance Analysis

Here, I picked three players from a T20 match and analyzed their fielding efforts like catches, run-outs, and runs saved. The goal was to see how fielding impacts a team's defense strategy.

* Tools & Help
I used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for all tasks. I also referred to external tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to understand the concepts better and complete the tasks.
